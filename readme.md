# AI Aim
This project is a simple AI-based aiming system that uses computer vision to track an object and control the cursor movement. It is built using the OpenCV library for object detection, MSS for screen capturing, and win32api and win32con for cursor control.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV 4.x
MSS
win32api
win32con
ait
## Installing
Install Python 3.x if not already installed on your system.

### Install OpenCV 4.x using the following command:
pip install opencv-python
### Install MSS using the following command:
pip install mss
### Install win32api and win32con using the following command:
pip install pypiwin32
### Install ait using the following command
pip install ait

## Running the project
Clone or download the repository.
Open the command prompt in the project directory and run the following command:

python ai_aim.py
Press the up arrow key to start the script and the down arrow key to stop it.

## Customizing the project
You can customize the project by changing the cascade path, detection scaling, and minimum neighbour values in the script. You can also specify the name of the object to be detected.

## Built With
OpenCV - The computer vision library used
MSS - The library used to capture screenshots
win32api - The library used to control the cursor
